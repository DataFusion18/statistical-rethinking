# The fact that tulips cease to grow entirely when the temperature is hot, in lieu of shrinking in bloom-size in a linear fashion, implies a non-linear model.
# This said, we can point to an interaction between water, shade (which together were shown to be conducive to tulip growth) and temperature.

## 7M2

# A regression equation that would make the bloom size zero whenever the temperature is hot would include only terms interacted with an is_not_hot variable, such that when
# this variable is 0, i.e. it is *not* is_not_hot, the bloom size would be zero.

# The relationship between the amount of food that a raven consumes and the presence of a wolf killing this prey cannot be entirely linear, as without the wolf the
# raven would not eat any food at all. Once the wolf does enter the picture, though, the relationship could thereafter be a linear one.
