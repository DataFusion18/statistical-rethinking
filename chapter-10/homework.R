# homework

## 10M1
# When moving from disaggregated to aggregated counts, the likelihood function must change from a Bernoulli/Binomial based model to a Poisson model 
# for trivial reasons: we are no longer modeling binary events, but instead discrete counts of events.

## 10M2
# A 1-unit increase in the respective predictor x should produce an exp(1.7) = 5.473x increase in the positive probability of the outcome variable 
# in a given (single) trial.

## 10M3
# In a binomial generalized linear model we are typically modeling the `p` parameter with a linear model. Because this parameter is defined as a probability
# mass it must be constrained to the interval [0, 1], and the logit link function ensures this constraint.

## 10M4
# In a Poisson generalized linear model we are typically modeling the `lambda` parameter with a linear model. This parameter must be positive (it gives
# expected value of the random variable, after all), and the log link function ensures this constraint.

## 10M5
# Concretely, using a logit link in a Poisson GLM would imply that the expected value would need to be between 0 and 1. My first instinct is that this has
# no real place, as this would convey a model in which we're after consecutive occurences of the positive event, or something to this effect. A Poisson(.8) curve
# is given here:

curve(dpois(x, .8), from = 0, to = 10)

## 10M6

# When only two event-types are possible and the expected numbers of each type are assumed to be constant across trials (i.e. the probability of
# each event is constant) then the binomial distribution gives the maximum entropy distribution.

# The Poisson distribution is used for counts that never get close to any theoretical maximum. It is the maximum entropy distribution under the same
# constraints as the Binomial distribution.

# The constraints for each are identical, as the latter is simply a special case of the former.

# The MAP estimation of a GLM assumes symmetric uncertainty around the posterior mode. In a logistic regression, uncertainty around a given parameter -
# `bpC` in this case, for example - should not be assumed to be symmetric, as middling values of this coefficient will produce altogether different
# marginal (proportional) changes in `p` (the probability of the positive event) than will extreme ones.

# In this particular model, the estimates for the intercept for the second chimp differ greatly. This chimp never pulled the righthand lever, implying that
# an infinite number of values for this intercept (given the fundamental behavior of the sigmoid, i.e. "saturation" when the values are really big
# or small) would be valid. MCMC can recover this "long-tail" of the associated posterior, while MAP - which assumes symmetry - cannot.
